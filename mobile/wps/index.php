<font size="4"><b>WHY WORLD PEACE SOCIETY?</b></font></center>
<br>
<font size="3">
World Peace Society initiated this project and it&#39;s the first sponsor, but other sponsors are both welcome and sought. As one who views our many sites will recognize, World Peace Society has already proposed a large array of tools that could generate billions of dollars of revenue for both non-profit and profit enterprises promoting peace. But such enterprises require a large amount of initial capital to make them successful. Dollars For Peace is a project to raise those funds and show the world that a large number of citizens really want peace. It will not only enable World Peace Society to spread our mission across the globe but allow us to assist other individuals and organizations that also want to promote peace. The more people, businesses, and organizations think about and express specific ways to end war and violence, the better. We all have to urge governments to more effectively confront this problem. The world spends billions of dollars on death and destruction and billions more on necessary reconstruction. Doesn&#39;t it make sense to generate only a few million <b>to try to create peace?</b></font>
